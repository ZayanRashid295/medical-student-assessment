## Usage Guide

### For Students

1. **Registration/Login**
   - Create a new account or log in with existing credentials
   - Access your personalized dashboard

2. **Selecting Cases**
   - Browse available medical cases on the dashboard
   - Filter by specialty, difficulty, or search for specific conditions
   - Click on a case to view detailed patient information
   - Start the case to begin the simulation

3. **Patient Interaction**
   - Engage in conversation with the AI patient
   - Ask relevant medical history questions
   - Perform virtual examinations through questioning
   - Receive real-time feedback from the AI supervisor
   - Pay attention to intervention alerts for learning guidance

4. **SOAP Note Writing**
   - After completing the patient interaction, write your SOAP note
   - Fill in all four sections: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan
   - Submit for AI evaluation and feedback

5. **Review Performance**
   - View detailed feedback on your SOAP note
   - Compare with AI-generated reference notes
   - Review analytics and progress tracking
   - Follow personalized recommendations for improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI responses not working**
   - Verify your OpenAI API key is correctly set in `.env.local`
   - Check that you have sufficient API credits
   - Ensure the API key has the correct permissions

2. **Data not persisting**
   - The app uses browser localStorage for data storage
   - Clearing browser data will reset progress
   - Consider implementing database storage for production use

3. **Performance issues**
   - AI responses may take a few seconds to generate
   - Ensure stable internet connection for API calls

### Support

For technical issues or questions:
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify environment variables are properly configured
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly

## Future Enhancements
